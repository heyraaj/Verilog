# Verilog
**CPU Architecture Definition:**

**Name: CryptoSpark**

**Instruction Size: 19-bit**

**Specialized Application: Cryptography and Signal Processing**

**Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):**

The CryptoSpark ISA is designed to efficiently execute cryptographic and signal processing algorithms. The instruction set consists of 32 instructions, divided into five categories:

**Category 1: Arithmetic and Logical Instructions**
ADD (19-bit): Add two 19-bit registers
SUB (19-bit): Subtract two 19-bit registers
MUL (19-bit): Multiply two 19-bit registers
DIV (19-bit): Divide two 19-bit registers
AND (19-bit): Bitwise AND of two 19-bit registers
OR (19-bit): Bitwise OR of two 19-bit registers
XOR (19-bit): Bitwise XOR of two 19-bit registers
NOT (19-bit): Bitwise NOT of a 19-bit register
**Category 2: Cryptographic Instructions**
AES_ENC (19-bit): AES encryption of a 128-bit block
AES_DEC (19-bit): AES decryption of a 128-bit block
SHA256 (19-bit): SHA-256 hash of a 512-bit block
RSA_EXP (19-bit): RSA exponentiation (modular exponentiation)
**Category 3: Signal Processing Instructions**
FFT (19-bit): Fast Fourier Transform of a 256-point complex vector
IFFT (19-bit): Inverse Fast Fourier Transform of a 256-point complex vector
FIR (19-bit): Finite Impulse Response filter of a 128-point real vector
**Category 4: Control Flow Instructions**
JMP (19-bit): Unconditional jump to a 19-bit address
BEQ (19-bit): Branch if equal to a 19-bit address
BNE (19-bit): Branch if not equal to a 19-bit address
BLT (19-bit): Branch if less than a 19-bit address
BGT (19-bit): Branch if greater than a 19-bit address
**Category 5: Load and Store Instructions**
LD (19-bit): Load a 19-bit word from memory to a register
ST (19-bit): Store a 19-bit word from a register to memory
**Architectural Specification:
**
**Pipeline Stages:**
Instruction Fetch (IF): Fetch a 19-bit instruction from memory
Instruction Decode (ID): Decode the instruction and generate control signals
Operand Fetch (OF): Fetch operands from registers or memory
Execution (EX): Execute the instruction using the ALU or specialized units
Memory Access (MA): Access memory for load and store instructions
Write Back (WB): Write the result back to a register
Register File:
16 general-purpose registers, each 19 bits wide
4 specialized registers for cryptographic and signal processing units
**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**
Performs arithmetic and logical operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
Supports 19-bit operands
**Memory Interfaces:**
Instruction Memory Interface: 19-bit instruction bus, 16-bit address bus
Data Memory Interface: 19-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus
